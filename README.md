Face Recognition and Crowd Counting System

This project encompasses three key functionalities:

Individual Authentication: A deep learning-based face recognition system using CNN to authenticate individuals, integrated with a MERN stack application for secure access control.

Group Authentication: A robust face recognition system leveraging MTCNN and pre-trained models (FaceNet/ArcFace) for authenticating groups of individuals in a single image, ensuring efficient attendance tracking.

Large Gathering Face Counting: A scalable solution using advanced algorithms like YOLO and MCNN for real-time face detection and crowd counting in high-density gatherings, providing statistical insights.

This system combines deep learning, computer vision, and a MERN stack to deliver secure, scalable, and real-time solutions for authentication and crowd management
